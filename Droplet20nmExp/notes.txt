What is going on:

CURRENT WORK DIR:
/home/michele/python_for_md/Droplet20nmExp/SubstrateSpreading/Q2/Flat

[1]	Need to restart advancing and receding wetting simulations to tackle the
	problem of different equilibrium contact angles. Is that just a metastability
	issue? is it something more complex? Let's find out!
	-> 	Restart sitting and receding simulations for a=1.75 (i.e. w5) and advance for
		other 5.0 ns (in both cases)

[2]	Try to employ a thermostat s.t. only the substrate is coupled. Try also to reduce the
	coupling time to around 1.0 ps and see what happens. Can use the w5 configuration as
	a benchmark.
	->	What if it does not work? Well, go for artificial precursor film!

[3]	Lambda simulations: maybe not in the spreading droplet case...
