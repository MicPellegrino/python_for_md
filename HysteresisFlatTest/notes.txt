Apparently, LJ walls won't work (I need to investigate why).

STEP 1:
	Make a droplet sit on a flat SiO2 substrate with equilibroum contact angle
	theta = 70deg
STEP 2:
	Apply a body force to SOL in order to study the critical stress value for which
	the droplet starts moving; the angle difference associated at that stess would
	be the one associated with hysterisi

Body forces values:
	1) 1.00e-3 nm ps^-2
	2) 0.75e-3 nm ps^-2
	3) 1.25e^3 nm ps^-2	(WRONG INITIAL CONDITION!)
